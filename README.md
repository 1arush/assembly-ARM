# ARM-Sim
Contains various code segments from Computer Architecture course. They perform basic operations on data items by directly using registers
and memory accesses by load/store instructions. Loops have been implemented using branch statements. There are also code snippets for construcing
functions in ARM.

It involves writing assembly code on an ARM-based architecture.

The program for ARM-Sim can be found at https://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/~nigelh/ARMSim-V2.1/
